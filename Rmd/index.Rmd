## Aim

To estimate the case fatality rate for nCoV based on available data on cases and deaths.

## Methods summary

• We used the same method as for the Ebola Lancet piece, which estimated a corrected CFR rather than using a naive cases/deaths calculation. We assumed a 13.8 day onset-to-death for nCoV (Nishiura et al pre-print). Distribution shown in Figure 1A.

• We only have decent total incidence estimates from 16th Jan onwards (Figure 2B), so if the delay is ~13 days, we're now just getting to the point where we can calculate outcomes from this period (because otherwise the death outcomes will include cases prior to 16th Jan). So we did a (very) rough extrapolation to generate some more data points.

• The 'corrected CFR' based on the raw counts was implausibly large because there have been a hundred or so deaths in the past week, but there were only a couple of hundred cumulative cases 12 days ago (when these deaths would have had onset on average).

• So instead we looked at estimated CFR when case numbers are scaled up based on our relative reported estimates from Wuhan = factor of ~65 (for comparison, the Wu et al Lancet analysis produced a factor of ~100). We assumed all deaths were reported as in the raw data.

## Key results

• Using case data scaled for reporting compared to that for exported cases, we obtained an adjusted CFR estimate that was declining as more data came in. **Extrapolating current growth of cases and deaths, we'd expect the cCFR estimate to coverge to around 0.4% in the next couple of weeks (Figure 1C, solid blue line).**.
